# spotify

## Misson: a side project I'm building for fun and growth! 
I've been a spotify user since late 2011/early 2012 (will fact-check soon), and currently I have have something in the neighborhood of 500 playlists.
Lately its been getting to the point to where I have too many songs and playlists to organize with the current UI. 
I'm looking to make an interface that will better allow me to visualize, organize, and reason about this set of data. 

## Goals 
At the very least I could expect to learn about Front-end development and data engineering, but I've already learned about Python virtual environments - it sounds silly, but enviroments and tooling has usually been handled for me in my jobs
